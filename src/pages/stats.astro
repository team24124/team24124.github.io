		<h2>The EPA Model</h2>
		<p>
			The Expected Points Added (EPA) Model was originally developed by <a
				href="https://www.statbotics.io/blog/intro">Statbotics</a
			> for use in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). Nighthawks Robotics
			has used this model to generate statistics for all FIRST Tech Challenge
			(FTC) teams in the Alberta region and have provided the following data
			visualization to help teams view their historical EPA.
		</p>
		<p>
			Data is up to date to include <i>FIRST Championship</i>.
